This is my personal site! It's a portfolio of some of my projects and design work. 

This project was built using the Gatsby hello-world starter: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world.
It was developed with React and Javascript. 

To edit and kick off this project on your local machine:

    ```
    cd partialfractions.github.io
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
The project will run on `http://localhost:8000`!
