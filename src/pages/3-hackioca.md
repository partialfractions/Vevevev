For April Fools 2019, Hack the North planned a fake boba themed hackathon in light of food and social media trends. I was tasked, along with Mudmie, a product designer on Hack the North, with the Hackioca website, and I was able to contribute greatly to the site's assets and hero design.

## Colours

Branding was a design team effort. One aspect in our branding process was selecting a vibrant and welcoming colour pallet. We selected our pallet based on what we would normally see in tea shops: warm colours from popular drinks such as milk tea and fruit slushes.

## Logo

When contemplating an image that represented Hackioca, I combined the aspect of innovation in hackathons with bubble tea. A light bulb is a classic icon for creativity and ideas. Upon researching trends in bubble tea, I also came across tea shops that served their drinks in repurposed light bulbs. After iterations, this eventually lead to a light bulb carrying a classic boba drink being the logo of Hackioca.

## Hero

The design team wanted the Hackioca website to be interactive, as if the user was customizing a drink. This interaction would be in the hero, providing a delightful surprise and creating a connection upon a user's visit to the site. Rough ideas included being able to choose a drink's flavour and topping, but it had to be implemented in a clean and intuitive fashion.

## Interaction

Vertical carousels were decided to present the different ways that visitors to the site could customize their drinks. There would be 2 carousels: one of them would present flavour options and the other would present options for the drink toppings. In the carousels, the items would be presented as illustrations with tooltips that appeared on hover detailing what the illustration depicted. This made it so that the necessary text wouldn't be small and hard to read after being fitted to the carousel's width. As well, arrows and scrolling eased navigation through the carousel, making it easy for the user to explore all of their options.

On changing the flavour, not only would the flavour in the main image change but so would the background colour of the site. The same applies for the background images and the main image on changing the drink topping. This choice was to drive the interaction between users and the build your own drink component throughout the site.

The main image in the site also was not a typical bubble tea cup, but the light bulb from the logo. This was a way to integrate the logo into the website and allow users to better connect to Hackioca by being able to make a part of the branding theirs.

Additionally, bouncing and sliding animations would smoothly transition flavours and toppings on the main image as they were being changed, allowing users to see their choices instantly.

The final hero was a fun delight to introduce and connect visitors to the Hackioca site. It was also a wonderful practice in designing an effective selection tool, visualizing selections, and tailoring a part of the product to users.

## Assets

In addition to the design and assets in the hero, I was tasked with illustrating the all of the assets in the website. This included the background images for all the different variations of each topping, the boba cups that were used for judge photos, and a placeholder asset for the About section.

For the placeholder asset, I took inspiration from how tapioca pearls, a common topping in bubble tea, were cooked to depict that an event of connection and fun was "boiling up." The gif was animated with Photoshop frames.

Overall, the entire Hackioca project was a joy and a great learning experience in terms of branding, interaction design, and adapting to a different style of graphic design.
