Wachow is a casual word game loosely based off of the classic mobile game, Fruit Ninja. Scrambled Scrabble-like tiles are thrown up onto the screen, and players have a few seconds to identify a valid Scrabble word and swipe the tiles that spell out that work in one motion. When ideating Wachow, there was uncertainty of how the game would be surfaced. It could have been it's own casual game, but it was decided to be designed as a mini training game in Words with Friends.
