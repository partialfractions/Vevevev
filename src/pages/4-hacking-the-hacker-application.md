This year, one way that Hack the North is aiming to connect with hackers is to provide insights into applying to, attending, and organizing hackathons through Medium articles written by Hack the North's very own organizers. By connecting my own ideas and Hack the North's branding, I was able to create a series of cover illustrations for these written pieces.

Each Medium article also had a purpose to connect readers to some of Hack the North's organizers and thus the event that they work towards. The article Hacking the Hacker Application features Kouthar, the author of the article and a hacker herself, reflecting on her skills in software, hardware, and design, which are fields that hackers can work in at Hack the North.

This illustration intends to portray that Kouthar has been in the shoes of those applying to hackathons, and having gone from hacking to organizing the hacking, she's able to share her wisdom to make writing hacker applications less stressful for others.
