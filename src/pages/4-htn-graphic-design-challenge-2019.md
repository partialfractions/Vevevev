This challenge was to create a 4 page booklet to provide high level information of the Astrup Fearnley Museet for visitors. Besides theÂ copy, which was provided in the challenge specification, I was encouraged to research the type of art and atmosphere that was prevalent in the museum to influence my creativity. From photos I saw of the museum as well as the art being showcased at the time, my goal was to welcome readers to the museum through the booklet by replicating the museum's creativity and friendly environment.

My motivation for the colour pallet kept warmth in mind to foster a warm, cozy, and welcoming atmosphere, with a rich blue to balance the composition. The cover features bold paint drips, a homage to one of the most prevalent art mediums. The back cover makes use of negative space to make clear key information to potential visitors.

Inside the catalogue, I used both pages to display information in a landscape composition. This allowed me to create a larger more cohesive composition of my own illustrations to further convey the atmosphere of the museum to readers: open, clean, and contemporary.
<br/>
<br/>
My next step in improving this piece would be to improve the information layout inside the booklet. Reading across both pages can be unintuitive, and displaying the information in a more natural layout while keeping the open composition of illustrations will be a great challenge that will lead to easier reading for users. Overall, this design challenge was a great experience to practice portraying a message not just through colours and pictures, but through text layout and functionality as well.
