Traditionally, the FAQ section on the Hack the North website displayed all the questions and answers out in the open.

The benefit to this is that site visitors can have all of the answers to the FAQ questions in an instant. However, all the text can be overwhelming and lead to lots of scrolling, especially on mobile devices.
<br/>
I was able to add a drop-down for every question in the FAQ section for the 2019 site. This not only decluttered the section, but presented the questions to users in a way that allowed them to select the ones that they wanted the answer to. Having the first two answers open as well as arrow buttons that indicate the direction the answer will animate on click signal to the user that the each questions is a drop-down.

Adding the drop-down questions has an additional benefit: clicks are tracked on the Hack the North site allowing us to produce a heat map. The heat map allows Hack the North organizers to see which questions are the most and least clicked. This allows us to evaluate certain questions that may not get as much traffic with the purpose of curating common and valuable questions that would reduce the workload put on the support squad if they were in the FAQ. Reducing the number of inquiries sent to the support squad also reduces inconveniences for inquirers.
